#' clustack: Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Cluster Detection Using Stacking
#' @description `clustack` is an R package that implements a stacking approach to spatial cluster detection. Based on the Poisson-likelihood, single-cluster models are combined using likelihood-based weights, resulting in cell-wise stacked relative risk estimates.  Adjustment for overdispersion is available. The number of clusters is selected using (quasi-) information criteria. Methods for calculating cell-wise confidence bounds for stacked estimates are also provided.
