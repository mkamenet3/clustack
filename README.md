# clustack: A Stacking Approach to Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Cluster Detection

`clustack` is an R package based on * Spatial and Spatio-Temporal Cluster Detection Using Stacking* (Kamenetsky, Zhu, Gangnon). `clustack` implements a Poisson to stack cluster estimates. Adjustment for overdispersion is available. The number of clusters is selected using (quasi-) information criteria.


Code developed by and repository maintained by M.Kamenetsky.
